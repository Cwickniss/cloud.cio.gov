## Cloud Smart

The **2018 Federal Cloud Computing Strategy - Cloud Smart** - is a long-term,
high-level strategy to drive cloud adoption in Federal agencies.

**Cloud Smart** focuses on three inter-related areas to drive cloud adoption
through building knowledge in government and removing burdensome policy barriers:

* Security,
* Procurement, and
* Workforce.

## Instructions for Public Comment

This is a draft strategy open for public feedback. You may provide feedback in three ways:

1. Content suggestions and discussions are welcome via GitHub “issues.” Each issue is a conversation initiated by a member of the public. We encourage you to browse and [join in on discussions](https://github.com/ombegov/cloud.cio.gov/issues) in existing issues, or start a new conversation by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/ombegov/cloud.cio.gov/issues/new).

2. Direct changes and line edits to the content may be submitted through a ["pull request"](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) by clicking "Edit this page" on any site page in [the repository](https://github.com/ombegov/cloud.cio.gov/tree/gh-pages/pages/). You do not need to install any software to suggest a change. You can use GitHub's in-browser editor to edit files and submit a pull request for your changes to be merged into the document. Directions on how to submit a pull request can be found [on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). Open pull requests for the proposed guidance can be found [in the site repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ombegov/cloud.cio.gov/pulls).

3. Send your content suggestions or proposed revisions to the OMB Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer via email to [ofcio@omb.eop.gov](mailto:ofcio@omb.eop.gov). Please note that all comments received will be posted publicly on this page.
